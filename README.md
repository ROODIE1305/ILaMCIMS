## **Key Features**  
1. **Centralized Inventory Management**: Manage inventory levels across multiple channels from a single platform.  
2. **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor live delivery progress, giving customers the ability to track their orders in real-time.  
3. **Inventory Forecasting** (Planned): Utilize basic machine learning to analyze sales trends and recommend which products are in high demand or declining in popularity.  
4. **Automated Returns Processing** (Planned): Streamline and automate the process of handling returns, ensuring quick and efficient resolution.  
5. **Sales and Purchase Reports**: Generate detailed analytics for business insights.

## **Scope of the Project**  
ILaMCIMS aims to address the following:  
- Optimize inventory handling for businesses with a single supplier and multiple sales channels.  
- Provide tools for real-time order and delivery tracking.  
- Automate inventory forecasting to help businesses make data-driven decisions.  
- Simplify returns processing to enhance customer satisfaction.  
- Enable seamless integration with third-party e-commerce platforms.  

This software is ideal for small to medium-scale businesses dealing with low-to-moderate order volumes.

## **Setup and Usage Instructions**  

### **1. Backend Setup**  
#### Prerequisites:  
- Python installed on your system.  
- PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase.  
- Git installed.  

#### Steps:  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ILaMCIMS.git
   cd ILaMCIMS

2.Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv ILaMCIMS
source ILaMCIMS/bin/activate  # On Windows: ILaMCIMS\Scripts\activate

3.Install Project Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4.Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the project directory and add the following variables:
SUPABASE_URL=https://cvkyeqhdiimxroujaojn.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImN2a3llcWhkaWlteHJvdWphb2puIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MzA5MjEyNzIsImV4cCI6MjA0NjQ5NzI3Mn0.CR3w_pKHwgOP0EwKpljruHoFzoJYkytacHvxFwODYlY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImN2a3llcWhkaWlteHJvdWphb2puIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTczMDkyMTI3MiwiZXhwIjoyMDQ2NDk3MjcyfQ.ihPBPuJdxfp7laTxWJYZDMrVHslQItl6X0o_BtS3Gd8

5.Run Database Migrations (if applicable):
alembic upgrade head  # Or the specific migration tool for the project

6.Start the Backend Server:
uvicorn main:app --reload

### **Next Steps After Starting the Server**

1. **Access the API Documentation**:
   Once the server is running, you can visit the automatically generated documentation page by opening your browser and navigating to:
   http://localhost:8000/docs
This page provides an interactive API documentation, where you can test each of the available API endpoints directly.

2. **API Endpoints**:
The FastAPI app includes several routes based on the routers you've registered in the `main.py` file. These are grouped by their respective prefixes:
- **Customers**: `/customers`
- **Order Items**: `/order_items`
- **Products**: `/products`
- **Orders**: `/orders`
- **Product Channels**: `/product_channels`
- **Sales Channels**: `/sales_channels`
- **Shipments**: `/shipments`

3. **Performing CRUD Operations**:
You can use the API documentation to interact with each of the endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for managing the resources. Here's how you can interact with each:
- **GET**: Retrieve data, such as all products or orders.
- **POST**: Add new records, such as creating a new customer or adding an order.
- **PUT**: Update existing records, like modifying a productâ€™s price or quantity.
- **DELETE**: Remove records, such as deleting an order item.

For example, to view all products, you would navigate to:
http://localhost:8000/products

yaml
Copy code
Or use the **POST** method to add a new product by providing the required details.

4. **Testing the API with cURL/Postman**:
Alternatively, you can use tools like **cURL** or **Postman** to manually make requests to the API. For example:
- **GET** request to retrieve all products:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000/products
  ```
- **POST** request to add a new product:
  ```bash
  curl -X 'POST' \
    'http://localhost:8000/products' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "name": "New Product",
    "quantity": 10,
    "price": 50
  }'
  ```

5. **Verify Data in Supabase**:
After making requests to the API (such as adding or updating records), you can log into your Supabase dashboard and check the corresponding tables (like `products`, `orders`, etc.) to ensure that the data is being stored and updated as expected.

---

### **Conclusion**
By visiting the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`, you can easily interact with your FastAPI application, perform CRUD operations on the database, and check that everything is working properly.
